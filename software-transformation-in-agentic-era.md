# software transformation in agentic era

Agentic AI systems - AI systems that can pursue complex goals with limited direct supervision - is a new concept defined first in the paper "Practices for Governing Agentic AI Systems" by OpenAI, which was published on Dec.14, 2023.

"Agentic", "Agentic AI", "Agentic AI systems" have rapdily become buzzwords.

Dec 11, 2024, when Gemini 2.0 was released, "our new AI model for the agentic era" was claimed by Google.

Jan.6, 2025, "The age of Agentic AI is here", in Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang keynote at CES.

The core of Agentic AI systems is the reasoning/planning/tools-use capability etc, which is introduced by LLM(including multi-modal large model).

the article "The Anatomy of Agentic AI" provides a comprehensive understanding of the technical point of view of Agentic AI systems.

Software will be reshaped in agentic era greatly. There are several implementation patterns, as illustrated in the following pictures.

## Pattern 0 

Pattern 0 does not include any agentic capability, it's traditional software, usually a big software system is consisted of client-side frontend and server-side backend, some software may only provide frontend part, or backend part.

No matter backend or front end, the function provided by the software is pre-determined by the source code, i.e, the programmed rule by the source code limit what the software can do.
